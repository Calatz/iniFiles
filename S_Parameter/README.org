This is one of the most important files of the server since it controls almost every major change in game.

*WARNING:* This file is still under documentation, you can help by sending issue/pull request, the only thing I ask you is to CONFIRM before sending.

It's a table that contents

Where:

- ID: =An integer for index=
- Value: =The value of the action=
- Chinese_description: =The chinese descritpion of the action=

We're documenting this on english so this will have ENGLISH description instead.
