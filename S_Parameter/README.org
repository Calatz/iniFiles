* S_Parameter.ini

This is one of the most important files of the server since it controls almost every major change in game.

*WARNING:* This file is still under documentation, you can help by sending issue/pull request, the only thing I ask you is to CONFIRM before sending.

It's a table that contents

| ID | VALUE | CHINESE_DESCRIPTION |

Where:

- ID: =An integer for index=
- Value: =The value of the action=
- Chinese_description: =The chinese descritpion of the action=

We're documenting this on english so this will have ENGLISH description instead.

You can also see some observations (NOT NEEDED WHEN EDITING)

| ID | VALUE | DESCRIPTION | OBS |
| 106 | 10 | Reduction of equipment durability when you DIE. | Can be 0. |
| 140 | 3500000 | Exp required to Level up 1 point of mastery. | Needs editing at C_Parameter.ini to work |
| 143 | 10 | How much EXP you lose when you die. | Can be 0. |
| 277 | 2 | How much Teleport stones you need to teleport | Can be 0. No stone needed in bag to teleport |




This file is a bit boring to document since there are a lot of parameters and their name is in chinese, not good translation even with translators tho.
